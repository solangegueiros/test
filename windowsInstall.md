&nbsp;

![Run ridk install](https://github.com/solangegueiros/test/blob/feature/WindowsSetupInstructions/assets/img/windowsInstall/windowsInstall-03.png)

## Set up

Clone this repository, and run the following commands in its directory:

```shell
bundle install
```

If you had this error:
Your Ruby version is 2.6.5, but your Gemfile specified 2.6.3
You must install the correct Ruby version, look [here](https://github.com/solangegueiros/test/blob/feature/WindowsSetupInstructions/windowsInstall.md#ruby).


Verify your installation:

```shell
ruby -v
bundler -v
bundle exec jekyll -v
```

None of these three commands should error,
and they should all print out their version numbers.

## Usage

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
You will now find a site located in `./_site` .
Each time you save a file, the site will get regenerated.
